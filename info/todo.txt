debug interpreter filewriting
 - store output files in experiments/<experimentID>/<target-maxclass>/<interpreterID_...systemIDs_Generation>

fixup UI for mapping interpreter files to patcher objects

create UI for Systems linkages

create UI for entering words


Debug: get patcher and objects to load

Edit patcher to draw a simple turtle object from coll and create an image file
make patcher stream the drawinf and create a video file
create a patcher that streams the values of a table as audio and create an audio file
combine patchee and create an audiovisual file

Create the buffer and matrix interpreters
Create a buffer interpretation method that
uses some kind of parameter noise (possibly smoothing function based on letters?) 

create a matrix interpretation method that uses parameters to generate hue/saturation values 

Create the dict interpreter class

add dict formats for chord, pattern and events

create interpretation methods and a patcher that uses these plus a generic dictionary 

create the model interpreter class

add model helper for vertex buffers
create a patcher that loads a model, and a script that saves it as an image

add model helpers for textures (should use code from matrix) 
test with a patcher

add model helpers for animations, and a patcher that uses these plus an events dictionary to record a video

add dict helpers for List and warp, as well as associated methods and patchers

add model helpers for morph targets and test

add design UI for each blueprint 

add a design/test UI for subroutines 

add cloud exporting for generated media 
Create a “best practices” guide (with examples)

design an experiment documentation protocol
