add multiple types of production processes to mimic different kinds of L-systems, 
could be for optimization (i.e. DOL-systems insteand of parametric)
or for illustrating a complex process (timed/graph L-systems) 

could also have a parameterDescriptors constant, an array of strings that weakly type the parameters as properties, 
i.e. time, connections, position etc...


add more static classes
 - for managing the patcher network,
