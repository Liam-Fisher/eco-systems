Interpretation methods are done in worker threads, which need to be passed:
    - the filepath of the module they use to interpreter the system 
    - the filepath of the module they use to format the interpreter results
    - a schedule containing the generations they interpret at

interpretations produce files that can be read by standard max objects.
these are known as "target objects".
the module used to interpret the system
for each possible maxclass of target object, there exist at least 1 formatting method (streaming, stored, or possibly both)
the formatting method is an async generator function 
streaming format takes an async iterable as an argument and yields a string to be written to the stream.
stored format defines a data object, then assigns the results of the streaming  properties
